SpringBoot Lombok Builder Pattern

This spring boot project will give a glimpse about, how to implement and use a less explored but powerful feature of Builder pattern provided by Lombok library.

In general we use Lombok library mostly to avoid boilerplate code for setter, getter, toString and constructor, but it also provide Builder pattern.

Builder Pattern is used to set those attributes which are required and it removes the mandate to set all the attributes of a POJO class.
But it provides one more feature which is less explored but powerful.

In this spring boot project we will explore that feature which is less explored but powerful and see how this help developers

Following two endpoints has exposed to show the difference.

1. /nationality
